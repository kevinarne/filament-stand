# Parts List
* 2 x panels from FilamentStand.svg (in Imperial units)
* 2 x 5/8" threaded rod sized based on your spool
* 4 x 8mm x 22mm x 7mm bearings
* 8 x 5/8" nuts
* 12 x 5/8" washer (make sure they are smaller than the bearing's outer edge, may need to use 1/4" washers instead)
* 4 x bushings from BearingBushing.svg

# Instructions
1. Laser cut or otherwise manufacture two of the part found in FilamentStand.svg and the four of the part found in BearingBushing.svg.
1. Press a bushing onto each bearing. The fit will be tight and assumes a 0.006" kerf.
1. On each threaded rod affix a nut and a washer. 
1. Slide a side piece on followed by a washer, bearing, another washer, and a nut. 
1. Use your spool to place the next set of nuts, washers, bearings, and additional washer. 
1. Slide the second side piece on, followed by a washer and a nut.

# Notes
This set was designed for a spool with a 7 7/8" diameter. It will work with larger diameter spools, but may not work with smaller diameter spools.

The cut files do not take the kerf into account.
